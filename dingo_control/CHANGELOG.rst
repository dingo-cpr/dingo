Changelog for package dingo_control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.0 (2020-08-10)
------------------
* Fix the controller parameters for omni control; behaviour is now the same as ridgeback
* Unified Dingo folders/files as much as possible, updated meshes, bumped CMake version and made roslaunch a test depend.
* Added dingo_control; split dingo_description into separate Dingo-D and Dingo-O flavours; still much work to be done here, but preparing hand-off for Tony
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
